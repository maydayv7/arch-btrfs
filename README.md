This repository consists of my Linux PC config. Feel free to go through.

## Distro
My distro of choice is Arch due to it's expansive and informative wiki and it's bleeding edge repos. I use GNOME primarily as my desktop environment, as I like it's workflow. I occassionally use KDE as my bling-bling DE :)  
See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/maydayv7/arch-btrfs/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions on how to install Arch on a Timeshift-compatible BTRFS partition. 

## Apps
See [APPS.md](https://github.com/maydayv7/arch-btrfs/blob/main/APPS.md) for the list essential apps that I always install.

## GNOME Extensions
See [EXTENSIONS.md](https://github.com/maydayv7/arch-btrfs/blob/main/EXTENSIONS.md) for the list of favorite gnome-shell extensions.
